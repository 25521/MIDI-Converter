# MIDI-Converter

Converts synthesia like piano tutorials to clean MIDI files, that can be further converted to mp3 or piano sheets.
It needs to know the distance in pixels from the top where an imaginary line would cross the black and white keys on the keyboard.
Also needs a starting frame, where none of the keys are pressed and the keyboard is clearly visible.

In the example folder, there is the result of the conversion to midi, mp3, and sheet music.

To convert to sheet music I used the program MidiSheetMusic-2.6 and to convert to mp3 I used this https://audio.online-convert.com/de/umwandeln/midi-zu-mp3 website.

Example photo of the first frame, a distance of 650 pixels would be appropriate in this case.
