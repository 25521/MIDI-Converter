# MP4 Synthesia to MIDI

Are you a penny-pinching upcoming musician like me, that wants to learn how to play the piano without paying a single cent?

Great this repo has you covered!

Simply find any synthesia style video-tutorial on youtube and copy the link.

Now run the script, answer a few simple questions, and there you go! You have a semi-beautiful midi file to further convert to sheet music or anything you'd like.

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
